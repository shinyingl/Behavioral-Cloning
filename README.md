**Behavioral Cloning**
======================

Still working in progress:

Initial commit includes current  ".ipynb" and two model outputs:
1. Toydmodel01.h5: A short model just to test out if the ouput will work with simulator on the work space. It seem to be outputing images, but I'm having trouble to make video with the images.

2. Buildmodel01.h5: A work-in-progress model. Initial try on the simulater will lead to another issue after running python drive.py. I got a error message of "Segmentation fault (core cumped)"
